## Specs

| Description                                                    | Input                                        | Output |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|
| Check if two words are anagrams.                               | "ruby" and "bury"                            | true   |
| Check if anagrams have different cases and are still anagrams. | "Tea" and "Eat"                              | true   |
| Account for multiple words being anagrams or 'antigrams'.      | "A decimal point." and "I'm a dot in place." | true   |
| Check if the inputs contain a, i, e, o, u or y.                | "rb" and "br"                                | "You need to input actual words!"  |
| Check if a word is an anagram and also a palindrome.           | "Animal" and "Lamina"                        | "Congratulations. Your anagrams make a palindrome too."   |
| Check if two words are 'antigrams'.                            | "ruby" and "stab"                            | "These words have no letter matches and are antigrams."   |
